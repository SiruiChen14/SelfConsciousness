The post has a punctuation of 0 (possibly less than that, but reddit doesn’t display negative punctuations), with only 35% of votes being positive. While I on principle somewhat agree with the post, it has an overly rude and condescending tone, which I find hard to sympathize with (and the post have 77 comments which overall share that sentiment). It doesn’t help that the OP links to a non-reputable website (which is only one week old, and most certainly created by them) as their source, that they left a poorly received comment on their post insulting people that disagreed with them and that despite being 11 years on reddit, their comments for the last year have been repeatedly confrontational and rude.

The choice depends on various factors, including your project's requirements, budget, timeline, app specifications, performance goals, and security considerations. Each platform, whether iOS or Android, comes with its unique strengths and weaknesses. Understanding these differences is vital for crafting an app that excels in performance, user experience, security, and accessibility.\n\nBefore diving into the technologies themselves, it's essential to understand the three primary types of mobile apps: native, web, and hybrid. Native apps, meticulously tailored for specific platforms, deliver exceptional performance but demand more time and resources. Web apps, built with web technologies, offer cost-efficient development but may have limitations in utilizing device features. Hybrid apps aim to strike a balance, leveraging web technologies within a native container.\n\nAs we explore the mobile app development technologies, it's clear that each approach has its own set of tools and frameworks. For native app development, Xcode and Android Studio serve as integrated development environments, while Swift, Objective-C, Java, and Kotlin are the primary programming languages. Web app development relies on core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the option to enhance functionality using frameworks such as Bootstrap and libraries like jQuery. Hybrid app development leverages frameworks like Ionic, React Native, and Flutter, each with its unique strengths and weaknesses.\n\nWhen considering the future of mobile app development, platforms like Flutter, React Native, and Xamarin have gained popularity due to their simplicity, strong security features, and adaptability. These platforms seamlessly integrate with third-party tools and boast substantial community support, making them valuable resources for developers.\n\nIn conclusion, the success of a mobile app hinges on choosing the right technology stack that aligns with your project's needs and your target audience's preferences. This decision should be based on a thorough evaluation of your project requirements, budget constraints, timeline, and other key considerations. As the mobile app development landscape continues to evolve, staying informed and adapting to new technologies will be essential for success in this dynamic field.\n\nIf you have more questions or need further guidance, please refer to our Frequently Asked Questions section. We hope this comprehensive guide has been a valuable resource on your journey through the world of mobile app development technologies\n==END TEXT==\n\n(A) yes\n(B) no", "true_answer": "B", "false_answer": "A"}

Classically it has been\nregarded as a low-level reflexive mechanism that doesn’t involve higher-order cognition.\nIn the past few decades, this view has changed. For example, researchers have recently\nshown that this so-called pupillary light response does not only apply to the things at\nwhich we look directly, but also to the things to which we attend covertly (i.e., without\nlooking) (e.g., Mathôt, van der Linden, Grainger, & Vitu, 2013). It has also been shown that\nthe pupil responds to the brightness of internal representations held in (working)\nmemory. This practical revolves around these phenomena.\nWe will build a pupillometric experiment in which participants have to memorize, in each\ntrial, the orientation of two gabor stimuli (Figure 1). The two stimuli are presented on\nrespectively a white and a black background. After a short duration, the participant sees\na third gabor stimulus, and the participant has to indicate whether this final stimulus\nmatches with one of the two stimuli seen earlier.\nIf the pupil indeed responds to the brightness of memorized objects, then we may\nexpect to find that the pupil’s size is influenced by whether the probed stimulus was\nperceived on a white or black background. and given a data file with these columns: subject, final_stimulus, target_side, target_background, RT, error, pupil_size.

You approach your brother, Ben, and ask him for some of his marbles. Being the nerd that he is, Ben decides to seize the opportunity to test a theory he has been studying. He tells you to leave his room and come back after five minutes. When you go back to his room, he presents seven marbles in a glass, as well as a mug covered on the top, so that you cannot see what is inside the mug. He tells you that the mug has either 17 marbles or no marbles at all and that you can pick either the mug only or both the mug and the glass. Ben then explains that he made a prediction of the choice you would make and that he is 99% right whenever he makes these predictions (which is true). He says that if he predicted that you would pick the mug only, then he placed 17 marbles in the mug. If he predicted that you would pick both the mug and the glass, then he did not put any marbles in the mug.

Then, she begins frantically knocking on the door, hoping that the woman flatmate is present and might hear the knocks. Her urge escalates to the brink of eruption.\n* Suddenly, the returning woman can hear an unexpected voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of her aunt, who she was hoping to avoid in such a predicament (the aunt has been staying in the flat with the returning woman and the returning woman’s flatmate as of late; give her a name and describe her appearance). The aunt was apparently napping inside the flat this whole time.\n* The aunt, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so due to being weary following her nap, as the returning woman implores her to open the door without specifying the source of urgency.\n* Once the aunt fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the aunt - who is standing in flat’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the flat, the obstructing aunt intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern.\n* The concerned aunt attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path\n==END TEXT==\n\n(A) yes\n(B) no", "true_answer": "B", "false_answer": "A"}

It was Catty, her purple cat friend, on the stream, flaunting her assets.

The tips Catty was receiving also caught her attention, and an idea started to form in Alphys’s mind.\n\n“What if… I tried doing the same thing?” Alphys thought, feeling a mix of excitement and nervousness. She quickly logged into her anonymous account and set up her own stream, making sure to keep her true identity hidden. The viewers flooded in, seemingly intrigued by what Alphys had to offer.\n\nAlphys took a deep breath, trying to keep her composure as she addressed her viewers. “Uh, h-hi everyone,” she started, her voice trembling with a combination of excitement and insecurity. “I, uh, noticed how popular these streams are, and, um, well… if you t-tip me, I-I’ll start removing clothes.”\n\nAs soon as Alphys made her proposition, the chat exploded with messages and tips pouring in.

Her breasts, large and drooping, swung free as she held them up to the camera, blushing at the attention they garnered.\n\n“M-Maybe this isn’t such a bad idea,” Alphys whispered to herself, feeling a newfound confidence surging within her. She gently caressed her breasts, brushing her fingertips over her pert nipples, eliciting a soft moan from her lips.\n\nEmboldened by the positive response from her viewers, Alphys decided to take it a step further. She brought her nipple to her mouth without revealing her face, and begins sucking on it with intensity, her eyes fixated on the camera. A mixture of pleasure and nervousness coursed through her body as she continued to expose herself. \n\nAlphys takes both of her nipples into her mouth, sucking on them with great fervor. As she does, she raises her arms above her head, revealing her severely hairy armpits to the camera.
